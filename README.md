# TerraGo — Tiny habits, lighter cities  
*Connecting everyday actions to “Cities of the Future”*

TerraGo is a gamified carbon-awareness app that turns small, easy habits into measurable urban impact. Users get a quick baseline, receive bite-size actions tailored to their context, and log proof with one snap—unlocking progress while feeding anonymized insights that help cities plan greener infrastructure.

## Why it fits “Cities of the Future”
- **People-powered infrastructure:** Citizens become active nodes in the city’s decarbonization network; aggregate micro-savings inform where to add bike lanes, tree cover, EV chargers, and transit tweaks.  
- **Optimized public resources:** Anonymized heatmaps of action uptake (e.g., short-trip swaps by suburb) help councils target investments with the highest CO₂e savings per dollar.  
- **Resilience & equity:** Low-friction, low-cost actions scale across diverse neighborhoods—no smart gadget required.  
- **Data with consent:** Privacy-first telemetry and opt-in sharing align with modern civic tech and digital governance.

## Core Features
- **60-second baseline:** Postcode, household, cars/fuel, trips/week, diet, solar → weekly CO₂e estimate.  
- **Action cards (8 at a time):** Ultra-simple, personalized micro-actions (e.g., replace one short car trip; combine errands).  
- **Proof capture:** In-app camera with liberal AI validation; gentle prompts request better photos only when needed.  
- **Progress & streaks:** XP bar, milestones, and an evolving **Rive** mascot (factory → sustainable hero).  
- **Weekly insights:** Saved-CO₂e and category breakdown (transport, diet, electricity).  
- **Explore tab:** Local tips and rotating city challenges that keep the next step obvious and doable.

## City-Facing Add-Ons (Future-Ready)
- **Civic dashboard:** Anonymized savings, action uptake by suburb, and trends; export as open data.  
- **Targeting engine:** Recommends micro-infrastructure (bike racks, shade, crossings) to unlock more behavior change.  
- **Program hooks:** Integrations for rewards (e.g., transit credits) and seasonal campaigns (e.g., heat-wave travel tips).

## Privacy & Ethics
- **Consent-driven:** Users control sharing; private by default.  
- **Data minimization:** Only fields needed for estimates; no precise geolocation required.  
- **Transparent use:** Aggregates fuel city insights—never individual tracking, never sold data.

## TL;DR
TerraGo scales tiny, joyful actions from residents into actionable signals for planners—closing the loop between citizen effort and smarter, fairer, *future-ready* urban infrastructure.
